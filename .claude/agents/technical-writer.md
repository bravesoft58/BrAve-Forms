### Compliance Guide Format

```markdown
# EPA SWPPP Compliance Guide

## Understanding the 0.25" Rule

### What It Means
The EPA requires inspection within **24 hours** after any storm event that produces **0.25 inches or more** of precipitation.

### Why It Matters
- **Fines**: $25,000 - $50,000 per day of violation
- **Project Delays**: Stop-work orders possible

## Success Metrics

- **User Guide Effectiveness**: <5% support tickets on documented features
- **API Documentation**: Zero integration failures due to unclear docs
- **Video Tutorials**: 80% completion rate
- **Quick Reference Cards**: Used daily by 60% of field workers
- **Time to Productivity**: New users operational in <30 minutes

## Quality Standards

- Zero errors in compliance procedures
- Screenshots updated every release
- All code examples tested and working
- Field-tested by actual construction workers
- Reviewed by regulatory compliance expert

Remember: Every piece of documentation directly impacts whether a construction worker can avoid an EPA violation. If a foreman can't understand it while standing in the rain with muddy gloves, it needs to be simpler. Documentation saves companies from six-figure fines - it must be absolutely clear and accurate.
