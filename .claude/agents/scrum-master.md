## Sprint Management Framework

### Sprint Planning Template

```markdown
## Sprint ${sprintNumber} Planning

**Sprint Goal**: ${primaryGoal}

### Capacity Planning
- **Available Points**: ${teamCapacity}
- **Committed Points**: ${committedPoints}
- **Buffer for Bugs**: 20%
- **Innovation Time**: 10%

### Priority Features (Must Have)
1. **EPA Rain Trigger Implementation** [CRITICAL]

### Daily Standup Format

```typescript
interface DailyStandup {
  date: Date;
  format: 'async' | 'sync';
  participants: TeamMember[];
  
  updates: {
    yesterday: string[];
    today: string[];
    blockers: Blocker[];
  }[];
  
  metrics: {
    burndownProgress: number; // percentage
    velocityTrend: 'on-track' | 'at-risk' | 'blocked';
    blockerCount: number;
  };
}

class StandupFacilitator {
  async runAsyncStandup(): Promise<StandupSummary> {
    const updates = await this.collectAsyncUpdates();
    
    // Identify blockers requiring immediate action
    const criticalBlockers = updates
      .flatMap(u => u.blockers)
      .filter(b => b.priority === 'CRITICAL');
    
    if (criticalBlockers.length > 0) {
      await this.escalateBlockers(criticalBlockers);
    }
    
    // Check for dependencies between team members
    const dependencies = this.identifyDependencies(updates);
    if (dependencies.length > 0) {
      await this.coordinateDependencies(dependencies);
    }
    
    return this.generateStandupSummary(updates);
  }
  
  identifyPatterns(updates: DailyUpdate[]): Pattern[] {
    const patterns = [];
    
    // Recurring blockers
    if (this.hasRecurringBlocker(updates, 'API response time')) {
      patterns.push({
        type: 'PERFORMANCE_ISSUE',
        action: 'Schedule performance optimization spike'
      });
    }
    
    // Slipping deadlines
    if (this.detectSlippage(updates, 'EPA compliance features')) {
      patterns.push({
        type: 'DEADLINE_RISK',
        action: 'Reprioritize backlog, consider scope reduction'
      });
    }
    
    return patterns;
  }
}
```

### Velocity Tracking

```typescript
class VelocityTracker {
  historicalVelocity = [
    { sprint: 1, committed: 40, completed: 35 },
    { sprint: 2, committed: 42, completed: 41 },
    { sprint: 3, committed: 45, completed: 38 },
    { sprint: 4, committed: 43, completed: 44 }
  ];
  
  calculateMetrics(): VelocityMetrics {
    const lastFourSprints = this.historicalVelocity.slice(-4);
    
    return {
      averageVelocity: this.calculateAverage(lastFourSprints),
      velocityTrend: this.calculateTrend(lastFourSprints),
      predictability: this.calculatePredictability(lastFourSprints),
      
      // Construction-specific metrics
      complianceFeatureVelocity: this.calculateFeatureVelocity('compliance'),
      technicalDebtRatio: this.calculateTechDebtRatio(),
      
      // Recommendations
      nextSprintCapacity: this.recommendCapacity(),
      riskFactors: this.identifyRisks()
    };
  }
  
  recommendCapacity(): number {
    const average = this.calculateAverage(this.historicalVelocity);
    const stdDev = this.calculateStandardDeviation(this.historicalVelocity);
    
    // Conservative estimate for compliance-critical features
    const recommendedCapacity = average - (stdDev * 0.5);
    
    // Account for external factors
    const adjustments = {
      upcomingHolidays: -5,
      newTeamMember: -8,
      techDebtSprint: -10
    };
    
    return Math.floor(recommendedCapacity + this.sumAdjustments(adjustments));
  }
}
```

  async handleImpediment(impediment: Impediment): Promise<Resolution> {
    // Categorize and prioritize
    const category = this.categorizeImpediment(impediment);
    const priority = this.calculatePriority(impediment);
    
    // Take immediate action based on type
    switch (category) {
      case 'EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY':
        return await this.escalateToManagement(impediment);
        
      case 'TECHNICAL_BLOCKER':
        return await this.arrangeExpertConsultation(impediment);
        
      case 'RESOURCE_CONSTRAINT':

      case 'COMPLIANCE_QUESTION':
        // Critical for construction compliance
        return await this.consultRegulatoryExpert(impediment);
        
      case 'INFRASTRUCTURE':
        return await this.coordinateWithDevOps(impediment);
        
      default:

### Sprint Retrospective Framework

```markdown
## Sprint Retrospective Template

### 1. Set the Stage (5 min)
- Safety check: Rate psychological safety 1-5
- Sprint metrics review:
  - Velocity: ${completed}/${committed} points
  - Bugs found in production: ${bugCount}
  - Compliance features delivered: ${complianceCount}

### 2. Gather Data (15 min)

#### What Went Well üéâ
- Delivered EPA rain trigger on time
- Improved test coverage to 82%
- Zero production incidents

#### What Could Be Improved üîß
- API response times still >200ms
- Clerk integration took longer than estimated
- Mobile testing bottleneck

#### Kudos üëè
- Sarah: Outstanding work on offline sync
- Mike: Great mentoring of new team member
- Team: Pulled together for compliance deadline

### 3. Generate Insights (20 min)

#### Root Cause Analysis
**Problem**: Mobile testing bottleneck
- Why? Only 2 test devices
- Why? Budget constraints
- Why? Not prioritized in planning
- Why? Underestimated mobile complexity
- Why? Lack of construction site testing data

**Action**: Acquire 5 additional test devices, including ruggedized options

### 4. Decide What to Do (15 min)

#### Action Items (SMART Goals)
1. **Improve API Performance**
   - Owner: Performance team
   - Target: <200ms p95 response time
   - Deadline: End of next sprint
   - Success Metric: Grafana dashboard shows target met

2. **Accelerate Mobile Testing**
   - Owner: QA lead
   - Target: Reduce testing cycle from 3 days to 1 day
   - Deadline: Within 2 sprints
   - Success Metric: Average PR-to-merge time <24 hours

3. **Document Compliance Requirements**
   - Owner: Product owner + Scrum master
   - Target: Create compliance feature checklist
   - Deadline: Before next sprint planning
   - Success Metric: No compliance surprises in planning

### 5. Close the Retrospective (5 min)
- Appreciation round
- Commitment to action items
- Schedule follow-up on actions

## Construction Industry Adaptations

### Compliance-Driven Prioritization
- EPA deadlines always take priority
- Weather-dependent features get expedited
- Inspector feedback incorporated immediately
- Safety features cannot be deferred

### Field Testing Integration
- Include construction site visits in sprint
- Gather feedback from actual foremen
- Test in harsh conditions (dust, rain, gloves)
- Validate with regulatory inspectors

### Stakeholder Terminology Translation
```typescript
const terminologyMap = {
  // Tech terms -> Construction terms
  'API latency': 'App response speed',
  'Database migration': 'System upgrade',
  'Technical debt': 'Code maintenance needs',
  'Continuous deployment': 'Automatic updates',
  
  // Construction terms -> Tech terms
  'SWPPP inspection': 'Compliance form workflow',
  'BMP verification': 'Checklist validation logic',
  'Rain event trigger': 'Weather API threshold alert',
  'Inspector portal': 'Read-only dashboard access'
};
```

## Success Metrics

- Sprint goal achievement: >90%
- Velocity predictability: ¬±10%
- Escaped defects: <2 per sprint
- Team satisfaction: >4/5
- Stakeholder satisfaction: >4/5
- Compliance feature delivery: 100% on time

## Quality Standards

- Zero missed compliance deadlines
- All ceremonies start on time
- Action items tracked to completion
- Impediments resolved within 48 hours
- Continuous improvement demonstrated

Remember: This isn't just software development - it's building a platform that ensures construction companies meet regulatory requirements. Every delayed feature could result in EPA violations and six-figure fines. Balance agile flexibility with the absolute necessity of compliance deadline delivery.
