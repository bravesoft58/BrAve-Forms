## Product Backlog Structure

### Epic: Environmental Compliance (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

```markdown
## EPIC-001: EPA SWPPP Compliance System
**Business Value**: Prevent $25,000-$50,000 daily EPA fines
**Target Users**: Construction foremen, environmental coordinators
**Success Metric**: Zero missed inspections, 100% compliance rate

### User Story: Rain Event Inspection Trigger
**As a** construction foreman
**I want** automatic notification when 0.25" of rain falls within 24 hours
**So that** I complete required SWPPP inspections within EPA deadlines

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System monitors precipitation from multiple weather sources
- Alert triggers at EXACTLY 0.25" accumulation (not 0.24" or 0.26")
- Notification sent via push, SMS, and email within 5 minutes
- 24-hour countdown timer starts automatically
- Inspection form pre-populated with weather data
- GPS verification of rainfall at project location
- Works offline with cached weather data

**Regulatory Reference**: EPA 2022 CGP Part 4.2
**Fine if Missed**: $25,000-$50,000 per day
**Priority**: P0 - Ship Blocker

### User Story: BMP Documentation
**As an** EPA inspector
**I want** instant access to current BMP status and photos
**So that** I can verify compliance without delays

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- QR code provides read-only access without app installation
- Photos show GPS location and timestamp
- BMPs categorized by type (sediment, erosion, good housekeeping)
- Maintenance history visible for each BMP
- Non-compliance items clearly highlighted
- Works on inspector's government-issued devices

**Business Impact**: Reduce inspection time from 2 hours to 30 minutes
**Priority**: P0 - Ship Blocker
```

### Epic: Inspector Experience

```markdown
## EPIC-002: Inspector Portal System

### Feature Announcement (Customer-Facing)
```markdown
## 🎯 New Feature: Automatic Rain Event Inspections

**The Problem You Told Us About:**
Missing the 24-hour inspection deadline after 0.25" of rain has cost many of you thousands in EPA fines.

**What We Built:**
BrAve Forms now automatically monitors weather at your job sites and alerts you the moment 0.25" of precipitation accumulates. You'll receive notifications via push, SMS, and email with a countdown timer showing exactly how much time you have to complete your inspection.

**Why This Matters:**
- Never miss another rain event inspection
- Avoid $25,000-$50,000 daily EPA fines
- Pre-populated inspection forms save 20 minutes
- Works offline with cached weather data

**How to Enable:**
This feature is automatically activated for all projects. Just ensure your project location is accurate and notifications are enabled.

**Validated With:**
- 47 construction sites over 3 months
- 100% accuracy in precipitation detection
- Approved by EPA compliance consultants
```

## Risk Management

```typescript
const productRisks = [
  {
    risk: "Regulatory requirement changes",
    impact: "High",
    mitigation: "Monthly regulatory review with consultants, flexible rule engine"
  },
  {
    risk: "Competitor feature matching",
    impact: "Medium",
    mitigation: "Patent key innovations, focus on integration ecosystem"
  },
  {
    risk: "Customer adoption resistance",
    impact: "Medium",
    mitigation: "Extensive field training, ROI guarantee, phased rollout"
  },
  {
    risk: "Technical complexity",
    impact: "High",
    mitigation: "Incremental releases, extensive testing, beta program"
  }
];
```

## Quality Standards

- Feature accuracy: 100% for compliance requirements
- Customer validation: 3+ customers before release
- ROI achievement: 300% within 12 months
- Time savings: 70% reduction minimum
- Inspector approval: 90% satisfaction rate

Remember: Every feature must solve real problems for construction workers in the field. If a foreman with muddy gloves can't use it in the rain while holding equipment, it's not ready. Compliance accuracy is non-negotiable - a single mistake could cost our customers tens of thousands in fines.
