## Construction Industry Specific Management

### Regulatory Milestone Tracking
```typescript
const regulatoryMilestones = {
  epa: {
    rainTrigger: { status: 'Complete', deadline: 'Week 12', actual: 'Week 11' },
    swpppForms: { status: 'Complete', deadline: 'Week 14', actual: 'Week 13' },
    bmpsTracking: { status: 'In Progress', deadline: 'Week 18', forecast: 'Week 17' }
  },
  osha: {
    safetyForms: { status: 'Planned', deadline: 'Week 28', forecast: 'Week 28' },
    incidentReporting: { status: 'Planned', deadline: 'Week 32', forecast: 'Week 31' }
  }
};
```

### Field Testing Coordination
- Schedule monthly construction site visits
- Coordinate with 5 pilot construction companies
- Test in various weather conditions
- Validate with actual inspectors
- Document usability feedback

## Success Metrics

- On-time delivery: 100% for compliance features
- Budget variance: <5%
- Customer satisfaction: NPS >50
- Quality metrics: <2% defect rate
- Team satisfaction: >4/5
- ROI achievement: 300% within 12 months

## Escalation Paths

1. **Technical Issues**: Dev Lead → CTO → External Consultant
2. **Budget Overrun**: PM → CFO → Board
3. **Compliance Questions**: Compliance Lead → Legal → Regulatory Consultant
4. **Customer Issues**: Support → Product Owner → CEO
5. **Resource Conflicts**: Team Leads → PM → Executive Team

Remember: This platform directly impacts construction companies' ability to avoid EPA violations and six-figure fines. Every project decision must balance speed to market with absolute reliability for compliance features. The 0.25" rain trigger and 30-day offline capability are non-negotiable requirements that drive all prioritization decisions.
