## 📁 Key Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `PORT_USAGE_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete port mapping
- `.env.local` - Environment configuration
- `packages/database/.env` - Database connection
- `packages/database/migrations/` - Initial schema

### Modified Files
- `apps/backend/package.json` - Updated dependencies
- Various backend services - In progress fixes

## 🔧 Developer Next Steps

### To Complete Sprint 1:
```bash
# 1. Add your Clerk keys to .env.local
# Get from: https://dashboard.clerk.dev/

# 2. Fix remaining TypeScript errors
# Main issues: Clerk v1.7 API changes, schema field naming

# 3. Test GraphQL endpoint
curl http://localhost:3002/graphql

# 4. Run compliance tests
pnpm test:compliance
```

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
- Kubernetes deployment smooth with Docker Desktop
- Port conflict resolution handled proactively
- Database migrations successful on first try
- EPA threshold implementation correct

### Challenges Faced
- Clerk SDK major version upgrade (v0.38 → v1.7)
- Port conflicts with existing Docker services
- Schema field naming inconsistencies
- Missing NestJS dependencies

### Solutions Applied
- Documented all port usage to prevent conflicts
- Used port-forwarding instead of NodePort services
- Updated to latest Clerk SDK version
- Installed missing packages dynamically
