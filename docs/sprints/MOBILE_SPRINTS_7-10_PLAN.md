## üì± Mobile Development Strategy

### Key Advantages of Delayed Mobile Development
1. **Informed Design:** 8 weeks of web usage data shapes mobile UX
2. **Proven Features:** Only build what customers actually use
3. **Revenue Buffer:** Web revenue funds mobile development
4. **Reduced Risk:** Business model validated before mobile investment
5. **Customer Base:** Built-in beta testers from web users

### Mobile-First Features (Not in Web)
- Offline-first architecture (30-day capability)
- Camera integration with GPS EXIF data
- Glove-friendly touch targets
- Location-based site detection
- Biometric authentication
- Push notifications for weather alerts
- Background sync when connectivity returns

3. Create mobile UI framework
4. Set up Service Workers
5. Configure build pipelines

### Key Deliverables
```typescript
// Core Architecture Components
- Capacitor 6 project setup (iOS/Android)
