## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack (Next.js 14)
```typescript
// Core Dependencies
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Mantine v7 (UI Components)
- TanStack Query v5 (State Management)
- Apollo Client (GraphQL)
- Clerk SDK (Authentication)

// Development Tools
- ESLint + Prettier
- Vitest (Testing)
- Storybook (Component Library)
- Playwright (E2E Testing)
```

### Key Implementation Patterns
```typescript
// Multi-tenant data fetching
const useProjectInspections = (orgId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['inspections', orgId],
    queryFn: () => fetchInspections(orgId),
    staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes
  });
};

// Weather monitoring hook
const useWeatherAlerts = (projectId: string) => {
  return useSubscription({
    query: WEATHER_ALERTS_SUBSCRIPTION,
    variables: { projectId },
  });
};
```
