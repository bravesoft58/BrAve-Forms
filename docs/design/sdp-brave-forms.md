## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Development Plan defines the comprehensive methodology, processes, tools, and practices for developing the BrAve Forms Platform v1.0 - a web-first construction compliance and forms management system designed to reduce daily documentation time from 2-3 hours to under 30 minutes while ensuring regulatory compliance across federal, state, and local jurisdictions.

### 1.2 Key Objectives

- **Accelerated Delivery**: 4-month MVP development timeline using AI-augmented Agile methodologies
- **Quality Assurance**: Minimum 80% code coverage with AI-generated automated testing
- **Offline Resilience**: 30-day disconnected operation capability
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users
- **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type II compliance standards
- **AI Efficiency**: 2-3x development velocity through Claude Code and Archon integration

### 1.3 Development Approach

The project employs an **AI-augmented Agile-Scrum methodology** with 2-week sprints, leveraging Claude Code for agentic coding assistance and Archon for intelligent project management. The approach combines traditional Agile practices with AI acceleration, enabling rapid development while maintaining code quality through continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) and test-driven development (TDD) practices. Web-first development for rapid market entry, with mobile offline capabilities added progressively, is the core architectural principle.

### Appendix F: AI Tools Setup Guide

#### Claude Code Configuration
```bash
# Installation
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Project Setup
cd brave-forms-platform
claude  # Initialize Claude Code in project

# Team Configuration
export CLAUDE_API_KEY="team-api-key"
export CLAUDE_MODEL="claude-opus-4-1-20250805"

# Best Practices Configuration
echo '{
  "workflow": "test-driven",
  "codeReview": "enabled",
  "documentation": "auto-generate",
  "debugMode": "verbose"
}' > .claude-config.json
```

#### Archon Setup for BrAve Forms
```yaml
# Docker Installation
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/archon.git
cd archon
python run_docker.py

# Agent Configuration
agents:
  - name: "SWPPP Compliance Agent"
    purpose: "Monitor and validate environmental compliance"
    integration: "weather-api, regulatory-db"
    
  - name: "Sprint Manager Agent"
    purpose: "Manage sprint tasks and burndown"
    integration: "github, slack"
    
  - name: "Documentation Agent"
    purpose: "Maintain technical and user documentation"
    integration: "markdown, openapi"
    
  - name: "QA Automation Agent"
    purpose: "Generate and maintain test suites"
    integration: "jest, playwright"

# Supabase Vector Database Setup
database:
  provider: "supabase"
  collections:
    - "project-documentation"
    - "compliance-requirements"
    - "test-scenarios"
    - "user-stories"
```

#### Integration Workflow
1. **Morning Standup**: Archon agents prepare overnight reports
2. **Development**: Claude Code assists with implementation
3. **Testing**: Automated test generation and execution
4. **Documentation**: Real-time updates by Archon agents
5. **Review**: AI-assisted code review before peer review
6. **Deployment**: Agent-monitored release process
