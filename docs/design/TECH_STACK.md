# BrAve Forms Technology Stack

## Overview
BrAve Forms is built with modern, production-ready technologies optimized for construction field operations, EPA compliance, and 30-day offline capability.

## Backend Stack

### Core Framework
- **NestJS 10.x**: Enterprise-grade Node.js framework with modular architecture
- **GraphQL (Code-First)**: Type-safe API using @nestjs/graphql decorators
- **TypeScript 5.x**: Type safety and modern JavaScript features

### Database & ORM
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Primary database with TimescaleDB extension for time-series data
- **Prisma 5.x**: Modern ORM with JSONB support for flexible form schemas
- **Redis 7.x**: Caching and queue management

### Authentication & Security
- **Clerk**: Managed authentication with organization support
  - JWT tokens with org claims (o.id, o.rol, o.slg)
  - Multi-tenant isolation
  - SOC 2 Type II compliant
- **PostgreSQL RLS**: Row-level security for data isolation

### Queue & Background Jobs
- **BullMQ**: Production-ready job queue for:
  - Weather monitoring (0.25" EPA threshold)
  - Photo processing
  - Report generation
  - Offline sync operations

## Frontend Stack

### Web Application
- **Next.js 14**: React framework with App Router
- **Mantine v7**: Component library optimized for forms
- **TanStack Query v5**: Server state management with offline persistence
- **Valtio**: Client state management
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Form handling and validation

### Mobile Application
- **Capacitor 6**: Native mobile runtime for iOS/Android
- **React**: Shared codebase with web
- **Service Workers**: Offline-first architecture
- **IndexedDB**: Local storage for 30-day offline capability

### UI/UX Considerations
- Glove-friendly touch targets (44px minimum)
- High contrast for outdoor visibility
- Offline indicators
- GPS-tagged photo capture

## Infrastructure

### Cloud Services

- Reduced development time
- Secure by default

### Why PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB?
- JSONB for flexible form schemas
- TimescaleDB for weather time-series data
- Row-level security for multi-tenancy
- Battle-tested reliability

### Why Mantine UI?
- Comprehensive form components
- Accessibility built-in
- TypeScript-first
- Customizable for construction UX
