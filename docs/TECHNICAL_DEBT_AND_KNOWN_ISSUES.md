## üîß Development Environment Issues

### 1. Multiple Background Development Processes
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Resource usage, potential confusion  
**Status**: Active but manageable  

**Description**:
Currently running multiple background development server processes from troubleshooting session.

**Background Processes Detected**:
- Multiple `pnpm dev` processes for web application
- Multiple backend server instances
- Historical debugging processes still running

**Impact**:
- Higher memory and CPU usage
- Multiple ports potentially in use
- Potential confusion about which process is active
- Development environment "noise"

**Recommended Solution**:
```bash
# Clean up background processes
pkill -f "pnpm dev"
pkill -f "next-server"
pkill -f "nest"

# Restart with single clean process
cd "E:\Brave Project"
pnpm dev
```

**Timeline**: Next development session cleanup

## üé® User Interface & Experience Issues

### 2. Styling and Visual Polish
**Priority**: Medium (Sprint 3 focus)  
**Impact**: User experience, professional appearance  
**Status**: Functional but needs improvement  

**User Feedback**: "looks like shit but it works"

**Current State**:
- All functionality working correctly ‚úÖ
- Basic Mantine components rendering ‚úÖ
- Responsive design functional ‚úÖ
- Construction site optimization present ‚úÖ

**Issues Identified**:
- Color scheme needs refinement for construction industry
- Typography could be more professional

## üîç Code Quality Items

### 3. Linting and Type Checking Validation
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Code quality, maintainability  
**Status**: Not recently verified  

**Last Validation**: Not confirmed post-authentication removal  

**Required Validation Commands**:
```bash
# Code quality checks needed
pnpm lint          # ESLint validation
pnpm type-check    # TypeScript errors
pnpm test          # Test suite validation
pnpm build         # Production build verification
```

**Expected Outcome**: All should pass, but need verification after authentication changes

**Timeline**: Next development session start

## üå§Ô∏è Server-Side Warnings

### 4. Non-blocking Server Log Warnings
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Minimal - functionality not affected  
**Status**: Present but non-critical  

**Description**:
Development server occasionally shows warnings in logs that don't affect functionality.

**Common Warnings**:
- Next.js development server warnings
- React component rendering warnings (resolved)
- API connection timing messages (non-blocking)

**Current Status**: 
- Application works perfectly despite warnings
- User experience unaffected
- No functionality compromised

**Action Plan**: Monitor and address if warnings increase or impact functionality

## üîê Authentication Architecture

### 5. Future Authentication Re-implementation
**Priority**: Future Sprint (4-5)  
**Impact**: Production readiness  
**Status**: Intentionally deferred  

**Current Situation**:
- Clerk authentication completely removed ‚úÖ
- Development environment fully functional ‚úÖ
- Mock authentication headers working ‚úÖ
- Multi-tenant architecture preserved ‚úÖ

**Technical Debt**:
- Authentication will need re-implementation for production
- User management system required
- Organization onboarding process needed
- Role-based access control (RBAC) planning required

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- File structure maintained for easy re-integration
- Database schema remains multi-tenant ready
- API endpoints designed to accept authentication
- Development patterns maintained as if auth exists

**Timeline**: Sprint 4 or 5, when core features are stable

---

## üì± Mobile Development Considerations

### 6. Capacitor Mobile App Integration
**Priority**: Future Sprint (7-10)  
**Impact**: Mobile deployment readiness  
**Status**: Foundation ready  

**Current Status**:
- Basic mobile app structure exists
- Capacitor 6 configured
- Development server running on port 5174
- Not yet integrated with main application flow

**Technical Considerations**:
- Need to sync with web application state
- Camera integration for construction photos
- GPS/location services for project sites
- Offline sync implementation (30-day requirement)
- Construction site optimization (dust, water resistance)

---

## üß™ Testing Coverage

### 7. Automated Testing Suite Status
**Priority**: Medium  
**Impact**: Code reliability, regression prevention  
**Status**: Unknown post-authentication changes  

**Testing Areas Needing Validation**:
- Unit tests for modified authentication components
- Integration tests for API endpoints with mock auth
- Component tests for UI changes
- EPA compliance rule testing (critical - must be exact)
- Weather monitoring accuracy tests

**Compliance Testing Critical**:
- 0.25" threshold must be EXACT (not 0.24" or 0.26")
- 24-hour inspection window during working hours
- Multi-tenant data isolation verification

---

## üì¶ Dependency Management

### 8. Unused Clerk Dependencies
**Priority**: Low  
**Impact**: Bundle size, cleanup  
**Status**: Present but inactive  

**Current State**:
- Clerk packages still installed in package.json
- Not currently used in application
- Taking up space but not causing issues

**Options**:
1. **Keep**: Easy re-integration later (recommended)
2. **Remove**: Cleaner dependencies but harder re-integration

**Recommendation**: Keep for now, remove if bundle size becomes an issue
