# BrAve Forms Project Management Plan

**Project Name:** BrAve Forms EPA Compliance Platform  
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Project Duration:** January 6, 2025 - May 23, 2025 (20 weeks)  

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Project Vision
BrAve Forms transforms construction site compliance by preventing costly EPA violations through intelligent weather monitoring, streamlined digital inspections, and field-hardened mobile technology. The platform addresses the critical industry challenge of $25,000-$50,000 daily EPA fines for missed stormwater inspections.

### 1.2 Key Objectives
- **Primary:** Achieve 100% EPA CGP compliance with exact 0.25" rain trigger monitoring
- **Secondary:** Reduce inspection documentation time by 70% (from 3 hours to 30 minutes)
- **Tertiary:** Enable 30-day offline operation for remote construction sites

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- Zero compliance violations in field testing
- <200ms API response time (p95)
- 50+ enterprise customers within 6 months
- 99.9% platform availability
- 100% weather trigger accuracy

### 1.4 Critical Constraints
- EPA requirement: Inspections within 24 hours of exactly 0.25" precipitation
- Field conditions: Must work with gloves, in rain/dust, without connectivity
- Timeline: MVP required by April 25, 2025
- Budget: $1.875M total project cost
