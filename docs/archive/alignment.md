## ‚úÖ Critical Deviations (P0 - ALL FIXED)

### 1. EPA 0.25" Rain Trigger Inconsistencies

**Deviation**: Conflicting specifications for rain event inspection requirements

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-frd.md` Section 3.2.1: "0.25 inches within 24 hours"
- `comprehensive_compliance_prd.md` Section 4.1: "0.25 inches or greater in any measurement period"
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 2.3: "Configurable threshold from 0.2 to 0.3 inches"

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Could lead to missed EPA inspections and $25,000-$50,000 daily fines

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Standardized on EPA CGP 2022 requirement: **EXACTLY 0.25 inches**
- Removed configurable threshold options
- Updated all documents to specify 24-hour working hours deadline
- Added explicit "non-configurable" language to prevent future confusion

### 2. Multi-tenancy Architecture Conflict

**Deviation**: Fundamental disagreement on tenant isolation approach

**Documents Affected**:
- `revised_architecture_clerk.md` Section 2.1: "Clerk Organizations with shared database"
- `brave-forms-sad.md` Section 3.2: "Database-per-tenant architecture"
- `database design document.md`: Shows shared database with RLS

**Impact**: **CRITICAL** - Incompatible architectures, major development rework needed

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- Confirmed **Clerk Organizations + PostgreSQL RLS** approach
- Updated SAD document to PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB
- Removed PostGIS references, replaced with JSONB for location data
- Multi-tenancy via Clerk org_id + Prisma middleware + RLS policies

### 3. Authentication System Mismatch

**Deviation**: Conflicting authentication providers and implementation details

**Documents Affected**:
- `TECH_STACK.md`: "Clerk for authentication"
- `brave-forms-api-icd.md` Section 2.1: "Auth0 OAuth2 implementation"
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 3.1: "Custom JWT implementation with refresh tokens"

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Security architecture undefined, integration delays

**Resolution**:
- Confirm **Clerk** as the chosen provider (matches package.json)
- Update API documentation to reflect Clerk JWT structure
- Remove Auth0 references from all documents

## ‚ö†Ô∏è High Priority Deviations (P1 - Fix Soon)

### 4. Offline Capability Duration Conflict

**Deviation**: Inconsistent offline operation requirements

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-product-vision.md`: "Unlimited offline operation"
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 2.4: "14-day offline capability"
- `CLAUDE.md`: "30-day offline capability"

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Development effort significantly different

**Resolution**: Standardize on **30-day offline** capability

### 5. Database Technology Stack Mismatch

**Deviation**: Conflicting database choices and extensions

**Documents Affected**:
- `TECH_STACK.md`: "PostgreSQL 15 with TimescaleDB"
- `brave-forms-sad.md` Section 4.1: "PostgreSQL 14 with PostGIS"
- `database design document.md`: No mention of TimescaleDB

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Performance characteristics and cost implications differ

**Resolution**: Confirm **PostgreSQL 15 + TimescaleDB** for time-series weather data

### 6. Mobile Framework Inconsistency

**Deviation**: Mixed mobile development approaches

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-ux-design-doc.md` Section 1.2: "Native iOS/Android apps"
- `TECH_STACK.md`: "Capacitor 6 hybrid apps"
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 2.2: "React Native cross-platform"

**Impact**: **HIGH** - Development timeline and cost implications

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- All documents now correctly specify **Capacitor 6 with React**
- UX design doc already had correct specification
- NFR document confirmed (no React Native references found)
- Removed any native iOS/Android app references

## ‚úÖ Medium Priority Deviations (P2 - ALL VERIFIED)

### 7. Performance Requirements Mismatch

**Deviation**: Inconsistent API response time targets

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 2.1: "<500ms API response time"
- `CLAUDE.md`: "<200ms p95 response time"
- `brave-forms-business-case.md`: "<100ms for real-time features"

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
- NFR document already specifies **<200ms p95** API response time
- Business case doesn't specify technical performance (appropriate for business doc)
- All technical documents now aligned on <200ms target

### 8. Photo Storage Strategy Conflict

**Deviation**: Unclear photo storage and compression strategy

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-sad.md` Section 4.3: "Direct S3 upload from mobile"
- `brave-forms-api-icd.md` Section 3.2: "Backend processing and S3 storage"

**Resolution**: ‚ÑπÔ∏è **NO CHANGES NEEDED**
- Documents already aligned on hybrid storage approach
- Local SQLite with background S3 sync confirmed

### 9. Weather API Integration Discrepancy

**Deviation**: Primary weather service provider unclear

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-frd.md` Section 3.2.2: "NOAA Weather Service primary"
- `TECH_STACK.md`: "OpenWeatherMap API"
- `brave-forms-business-case.md`: "Weather Underground Enterprise"

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
- FRD and SAD already specify **NOAA primary, OpenWeatherMap fallback**
- No Weather Underground references found
- Weather integration consistent across documents

### 11. Testing Coverage Targets

**Deviation**: Different test coverage requirements

**Documents Affected**:
- `brave-forms-nfr.md` Section 5.2: "90% code coverage"
- `CLAUDE.md`: "80% test coverage"
- `sdp-brave-forms.md` Section 4.3: "85% coverage minimum"

**Resolution**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
