ok in free mode there is no way to add or edit sources that i can see, and i think free tier should still allow for up to ten sources, there still should be a admin screen with the same features as basic

in the basic tier update that to 25 sources and the recommendations as the differentiation

enterprise is up to 50 sources with the competitor engine
